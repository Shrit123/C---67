story *
Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey who resided on a jamun tree, 
which was on the bands of the river. In the same forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife. 
One day, the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree.
A kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits as he loved them. The day passed by, and the crocodile and monkey became good friends.
One day, the monkey sent some fruits for the crocodiles wife. She ate the fruits and liked them, but was jealous, 
as she didn't like the husband spending time with the monkey. She told her husband, "If the fruits are so juicy, 
I wonder how sweet the monkeys heart would be. Get me the heart of the monkey." The crocodile was not willing to kill his friend, 
but had no choice.
